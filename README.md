# Hi there, I'm Isabella Campisi

**Computer Science & Electrical Engineering @ Yale University**  
📍 New York, NY |  📫 isabella.campisi@yale.edu  
I'm an undergraduate at Yale studying EECS with experience in software engineering, game development, and AI. I’ve contributed to multi-disciplinary projects, supported peers as a CS learning assistant, and interned in systems and infrastructure development.

**Encore!**

I’m currently one of the core programmers on Encore!, a narrative game being developed by a 30+ person team and set to release on Steam. I’m building systems for game logic, interactive maps, and character interactions while working closely with artists and writers to keep everything aligned.

**Software Engineering Intern at Televiaducto**

At Televiaducto, I’m working on internal tools to automate infrastructure and improve billing systems. Lately, I’ve been prototyping AI integrations, reverse engineering legacy protocols, and refactoring custom monitoring systems to make them more reliable.
